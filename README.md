Abstract: The goal of this project was to perform exploratory data analytics on an MTA dataset with the intention of finding actionable advice to give to small businesses who cater to tourists near these locations. Data was pulled from the MTA website, and analyzed using various tools such as Pandas and SQL.

Design: 6 months of MTA data was pulled from the MTA website and compiled into a local database. The database was then imported into Pandas using SQL and SQL Alchemy. The data was cleaned and summary statistics were gathered for 4 MTA stations: Times Square 42nd Street, 81st Street Museum, World Trade Ctr, and Whitehall S-Ferry. 

Data: Average daily entries for each station over 6 months of 2021 was analyzed. Average daily entries 81 St Museum were 2272, 2309, 2713, 3199, 3758, 4221 respectively. Average daily entries for Times Square 42-ST were 13363, 12658, 15772, 17473, 19443, 22156 respectively. Average daily entries for Whitehall S-Fry were 2531, 2529, 3017, 3354, 3788, 4294. Average daily entries for World Trade Ctr were 1608, 1492, 1873, 2317, 2810, 3402 respectively.

Algorithms: This was an exploratory data analysis, so no statistical models or algorithms were used. 

Tools: SQL, SQLAlchemy, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keynote.

Communication: The results and conclusions were reported on a set of slides made in Keynote and presented to the Metis EDA cohort on 6/22/2021.
